# BIOC-4010 Resources 
This repository includes codes and files for the dry lab sessions of BIOC-4010,
2021W semester at the University of Windsor, Canada. These codes are tailored
for a Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM). Keep in mind that once you log out of
the VM, all the changes you made are lost and you'll have to set them up again.

Files are organized according to the tutorial session, each folder has a
`README.md` file.

The content shall be used in companion with the slides file provided to the
students.

To download the files, start the Ubuntu terminal in the VM, and run the
following commands:

```
git clone https://www.github.com/tongalumina/bioc4010.git
cd bioc4010
chmod u+x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
